            <h2>Etymology</h2>
            
            <article>
                <p>Pahalgam literally means "village of the shepherds" in Kashmiri, with "Puheyl" meaning shepherd and "goam"

                is mentioned as "Bailgaon", meaning "village of the bull", to indicate where the Hindu god Shiva left his bull
